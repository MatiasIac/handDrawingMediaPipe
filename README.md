# Hand Drawing with Google MediaPipe and Python

This repository contains two sample applications created for a local Tauranga (New Zealand) STEM Fest event with the intention of showing come of the Google MediaPipe capabilities and, additionally, targeting the participants of the event. Mostly kids between 8 to 13 years old.

Both applications uses the hand tracking solution. One with Python and OpenCV and the second one running in the browser using JavaScript and Blockly as coding interface.


## Requirements

You might need the following to run the Python application:

- Python 3.8.x
- OpenCV 2 or greater
- Numpy
- Google MediaPipe

You might need the following to run the web browser based application:

- A simple HTTP server hosting the main page.
- That's all :)

### Possible issues:

The web browser application uses CDNs references for MediaPipe and other libraries. If the third party provider decides in the future to remove access to these libraries, you will need to replace it for the expected ones.

### Impotant note:

This took me days of development. I am providing this for free because I believe that knowledge, transfering it, it is the most important thing that we can do to keep our art growing and with good health.

So, you can use it freely. Learn from it. Just use it.

**What I would like to ask you if this helped you in any way?** Quite simple! You could refer me as the creator of this code if you use it in a presentation. You could donate some money to help me keeping me doing more cool stuff. You could say thank you :), be creative.

Enjoy!
